# Covid-19-future-Forecasting
It is a project which focuses on predicting future covid-19 cases ,fatalities and recoveries using a trained dataset. I have used python language to make this project and framework was flask, IDE used is Pycharm and Libraries used are Pandas,Numpy,pymsql. Flask is used in Frontend and Sql in backend for database storage. User can Register, login and Choose 1 of 3 Algorithms to determine future cases etc. This is useful in predicting future cases and might prove helpful in better planning and coordination for future contingencies.
